# Jenny Lin - Project Portfolio Page for traKCAL

## Overview
* **traKCAL** is a desktop application for managing calorie intake, optimized for use via Command Line Interface (CLI) whilst retaining the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). **traKCAL** can manage your activities faster than traditional GUI applications.

### Summary of Contributions
This section shows a brief overview of my contribution to traKCAL. It includes contributions like code writing, code documentation, UG/DG writing and other contributions for traKCAL. 

#### Code contributed

My code contributions can be found [here](https://nus-cs2113-ay2021s1.github.io/tp-dashboard/#breakdown=true&search=&sort=groupTitle&sortWithin=title&since=2020-09-27&timeframe=commit&mergegroup=&groupSelect=groupByRepos&checkedFileTypes=docs~functional-code~test-code~other&tabOpen=true&tabType=authorship&zFR=false&tabAuthor=jlifah&tabRepo=AY2021S1-CS2113T-T09-4%2Ftp%5Bmaster%5D&authorshipIsMergeGroup=false&authorshipFileTypes=docs~functional-code~test-code~other).

#### Enhancements implemented

* I implemented the `user profile` and `short cut` enhancements. For `user profile`, **traKCAL** automatically asks for a new user profile if there is no current one and deletes it if there is an unreadable one. 

Here are some of their commands: 
* `user c/` to create a new user profile. At the same time, it also 
   * calculates bmi
   * calculates recommended calories
   * calculates calories based on weight goal
* `user e/` to edit 1 or more sections of the user profile. 
* `user l/` to list out the current user profile.
* `createSet` to create a shortcut with 1 or more activity.
* `addSet` to add all the entries within the shortcut to the current day's list.


**Justifications**: `user profile` feature gives the user a clear idea of their calorie journey. It also links to other features like graphs in traKCAL. `short cut` feature reduces user fatigue by offering a quick way to add in entries often repeated into the activity list.  

#### Contributions to User Guide 

* I contributed to section 2 (user profile), section 3 (shortcut) in the user profile as well as overall formatting of the User Guide. 

#### Contributions to the Developer Guide

* *Which sections did you contribute to the DG? Which UML diagrams did you add/updated?*

#### Contributions to team-based tasks

* I took part in brain storming user stories

#### Review/mentoring contributions

* I reviewed 25 PR from the team.

#### Contributions beyond the project team

* I helped test and identify bugs for other teams, some of my comments can be found [here](https://github.com/jlifah/ped/issues).
