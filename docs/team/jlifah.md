# Jenny Lin - Project Portfolio Page for traKCAL

## Overview
* **traKCAL** is a desktop application for managing calorie intake, optimized for use via Command Line Interface (CLI) whilst retaining the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). **traKCAL** can manage your activities faster than traditional GUI applications.

### Summary of Contributions
This section shows a brief overview of my contribution to traKCAL. It includes contributions like code writing, code documentation, UG/DG writing and other contributions for traKCAL. 

#### Code contributed

* I contributed the code for user profile and shortcut. 

> Special thanks to Karthig for improving the readability of initial command line and Owen for refactoring the code to different packages.


#### Enhancements implemented

I implemented the `user profile` and `short cut` enhancements. For `user profile`, **traKCAL** automatically asks for a new user profile if there is no current one and deletes it if there is an unreadable one. 

Here are some of their commands: 
* `user c/` to create a new user profile.
* `user e/` to edit 1 or more sections of the user profile. 
* `user l/` lists out the current user profile.
* `createSet` creates shortcut with 1 or more activities.
* `addSet` adds all the entries within the shortcut to the current day's list.


**Justifications** `user profile` feature calculates bmi, recommended calories and actual calories needed for user to get a clear idea of their calorie journey. It also links to other features like graphs in traKCAL. `short cut` feature reduces user fatigue by offering a quick way to add in entries repeated often into the activity list.  

#### Contributions to User Guide 

* I contributed to section 2 (user profile), section 3 (short cut) in the user profile as well as overall formatting of the User Guide. 

#### Contributions to the Developer Guide

* *Which sections did you contribute to the DG? Which UML diagrams did you add/updated?*

#### Contributions to team-based tasks

* I took part in brain storming user stories

#### Review/mentoring contributions

* I reviewed 25 PR from the team.

#### Contributions beyond the project team
