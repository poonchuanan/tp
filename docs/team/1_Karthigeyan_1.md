#### Enhancements implemented

*A summary of the enhancements you implemented.*

* I added the commandParser enhancement which filters the userinput to their respective command classes.
* I added the delete features (delete by index and delete all). Delete by index allows users to delete an activity by referring 
to the respective index in the list. Delete All is an enhancement on top of delete by index which allows users to delete all the activities in the list. 
> Commands:

so that users will be able to know if their goals are met.
