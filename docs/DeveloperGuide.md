<br>
<br>    
    
## 3.0 Design 

### 3.1 Architecture

![ArchitectureDiagram](diagrams/ArchitectureDiagram.png)

*Figure 1. Architecture diagram of traKCAL*

The Architecture Diagram shown above explains the high-level design of **traKCAL**. There are 8 components in traKCAL and their functionalities will be discussed below:

<br>

### 3.2 ui component

![Ui Component](diagrams/ui.png)

*Figure 2. Diagram for logic component*

<br>

### 3.3 Logic component

![Logic Component](diagrams/LogicComponent.png)

*Figure 2. Diagram for logic component*

The main bulk of data processing takes place in the logic component. In this component, 
the data from the userinput is checked for its validity and parsed down futher by the preparecommand class to its respective command blocks.
These command class are derived from the abstract Command class. Each different command block deals with the 
proposed functionality which can be associated with `Ui`,`storage` or `model` components. 

* **traKCAL** uses the parser class to filter based on command words by user.
* Description that comes after is further parsed down by the PrepareCommand class 
and validity of those description are checked..
* Respective Command object is created and is executed by **traKCAL**.
* Respective execution methods can be further associated with `UI`, `Storage` and `Model` components.

<br>

### 3.4 Model component

![Model_Component](diagrams/model.png)

*Figure 3. Diagram for Model component*


In the Model component, 

* Stores a DayMap object that holds the data for each date.
* Stores an ActivityList that holds the list of Activities, Food or Exercise for each day 
* Does not depend on any of the other components.

<br>

### 3.5 Command component

Before carrying out the command, user input first has to be prepared.

![Prepare_Component](diagrams/PrepareCommand.png)

*Figure 4. Diagram for PrepareCommand*

![Command_Component](diagrams/Command.png)

*Figure 4. Diagram for Command component*

<br>

### 3.6 Storage component

**traKCAL** saves both user profile data and activity entries in text file and csv(comma separated values) files respectively. <br>
It also handles the logging file that records down the different types operations or errors that was performed during the program.

![Storage_Component](diagrams/storage.jpg)

*Figure 5. Diagram for Storage component*

<br>

On program launch:

1. `Storage` is initialised and checks for existing saved data.
2. If saved data exists, `Storage` will read the saved data and parses them into model objects such as activity lists for the activity data.
3. Else, if saved data does not exist, `Storage` will create an empty save file in the tpData directory.
4. New users will be prompted to create their profile by inputting their details and saved through `UserInfoStorage`.

On Command execution:

* Whenever the user changes the list by performing an operation such as *add* or *delete* entry, `Storage` parses the model objects and writes into the csv file.
* The respective logs will also be updated according to the given commands through `Logging`.
* `UserSetStorage` will store the relevant shortcuts created by the using *createSet* command is called.

<br>

### 3.7 Exception component

![Exception_Component](diagrams/Exception.png)

*Figure 6. Diagram for Exception component*

<br>

### 3.8 UserProfile component

![userProfile](diagrams/UserProfile.png)

*Figure 4. Diagram for UserProfile component*

<br>
<br>

## 4.0 Implementation

## 4.1 Create User Profile feature

#### Current Implementation

The sequence diagram below shows how the components will react to a new user or for a returning user. 

![CreateNewUserFeature](diagrams/createNewUserFeature.png)

*Figure 7. Components interactions for **traKCAL** create user profile feature*

The following has been omitted from the diagram to increase readability: 
* Exception handling 
* External text file creation block

<br>

#### Design Considerations

* New users are required to create a new user profile before being able to use other features like `graph` to avoid unnecessarily being thrown exceptions.
* Genders were limited to female and male instead of other genders like binary as our recommended calories equation only took into account female and male as genders.
* Similarly, weight goals were limited to lose, maintain or gain as opposed to other forms of weight goal like cut as our current equations were only able to accomodate lose, maintain or gain.

<br>
<br>

## 4.2 Shortcut feature

### 4.2.1 Creating a shortcut

#### Current Implementation

The sequence diagram below shows how the components in **traKCAL** work together to create a new shortcut. 

Users can create a shortcut with unlimited number of entries in this format: `createSet **SHORTCUT_NAME** ...`

Some examples include:
>`createSet **SHORTCUT_NAME** f/ **FOOD_DESCRIPTION** c/ **CALORIE_COUNT** + f/ **FOOD_DESCRIPTION** c/ **CALORIE_COUNT**`
>`createSet **SHORTCUT_NAME** e/ **EXERCISE_DESCRIPTION** c/ **CALORIE_COUNT**`
>`createSet **SHORTCUT_NAME** e/ **EXERCISE_DESCRIPTION** c/ **CALORIE_COUNT** + e/ **EXERCISE_DESCRIPTION** c/ **CALORIE_COUNT** + f/ **FOOD_DESCRIPTION** c/ **CALORIE_COUNT**`

![createSetFeature](diagrams/createSetFeature.png)

*Figure 8. Components interaction for **traKCAL** create set feature*

<br>

#### Design Considerations

* At least one activity tag (`e/` or `f/`) and calorie tag (`c/`) must be specified by user for a shortcut to be created.
* The order of the entry must be activity tag first before calorie tag. Calorie tag followed by activity tag is not allowed. This is to facilitate the adding of each entry in the shortcut, as seen in [section 4.3](#43-add-activity-feature).
* Multiple entries in shortcut should be separated be a `+` as it is a key. 

<br>
<br>

### 4.2.2 Adding a shortcut to activity list

#### Current Implementation

The sequence diagram below shows how the components in **traKCAL** work together to add entries in a shortcut to the activity list. 

Users can call any existing shortcut in this format: `addSet **SHORTCUT_NAME**`

![addSetFeature](diagrams/addSetFeature.png)

*Figure 9. Components interaction for **traKCAL** add set feature*

The following has been omitted from the diagram to increase readability: 
* Exception handling 
* Components after adding each entry in the shortcut to the activity list as the same diagram will be repeated in [section 4.3](#43-add-activity-feature). Instead, it is replaced by the updateList() self invocation call. 

<br>

#### Design Considerations

* Activities added from shortcut are only for current date.

<br>
<br>


## 4.3 Add activity feature

#### Current Implementation

The adding mechanism is used by `AddFoodCommand` and `AddExerciseCommand` to add to the list of date stated in user input.

The following Sequence Diagram shows how `AddFoodCommand` is carried out when the user issues add command, in this case, `add f/ food c/ 170 d/ 2020-10-22`:

![Add Food](diagrams/addFoodFeature.png)

*Figure 10. Component interactions for add food command*

> `AddExerciseCommand` diagram has a similar logic.

![Add_Exercise](diagrams/AddExerciseFeature.png)

*Figure 11. Component interactions for add exercise command*

<br>

#### Design Considerations

Aspect: How to add activity

>Current choice: Using single letter words as tags for input commands. (e.g. add f/ jelly c/ 100 d/ 2020-11-09)
>* Pros: Faster and shorter input keys for user.
>* Cons: Have to ensure that user is clear on what tags to input.

>Alternative: Using full words as tags for input commands. (e.g. add food/ XXX calorie/ XXX date/ XXX)
>* Pros: Tags are obvious in what input is expected.
>* Cons: More wordy input needed from user.

<br>
<br>

### 4.4 Listing feature for find and list commands

The listing mechanism used by `ListCommand` and `FindCommand` to display the required list of activities is facilitated by the lastSeenList of class `ActivityList`. 
The following operations could be applied to the lastSeenList which would change the actual data in the database:

- delete
- move
- edita

The details of those operations can be found further down.

<br>

#### 4.4.1 List

This listing feature for the `list` command uses the lastSeenList which is of ActivityList class.  <br>
The lastSeenList is the list that the user would see after a `list` command. <br>
For example, 
* A `list 2020-11-11` command would use the activityList for 2020-11-11 as the lastSeenList.<br>

Using the lastSeenList allows users to make changes e.g `edit`, `delete`, `move` commands using the numbered index of a single `list` command.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the lastSeenList behaves for different `list` commands.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The lastSeenList will be pointed to the activityList for today's date.
This means that any `edit`, `delete` or `move` commands will be performed on the activityList for today's date in this case, the date would be 2020-11-12.
![lastSeenList first state](diagrams/initialStateOfLastSeenList.PNG)
*Figure 12. First state of lastSeenList*

<br>

Step 2. The user executes a `list 2020-11-10`. This `list 2020-11-10` command causes the lastSeenList to be pointed to the actvityList for 2020-11-10.
This This means that any `edit`, `delete` or `move` commands will be performed on the activityList for 2020-11-10.
![lastSeenList second state](diagrams/secondStateOfLastSeenList.PNG)
*Figure 13. Second state of lastSeenList*

<br>


The following sequence diagram shows how the lastSeenList is set after a “list date" command where date is of YYYY-MM-DD or after a “list” command where the date is the current date.

![Listing feature for find and list commands](diagrams/setLastSeenList.png)

*Figure 14. Sequence diagram of setting the lastSeenList after a `list` command*

<br>
<br>

#### 4.4.2 Find

This listing feature for the `find` command also uses the lastSeenList which is of ActivityList class.  <br>
The lastSeenList is the list that the user would see after a `list` command. <br>
For example, 
* A `find e/ food` command would go throught the dayMap and add activities containing the keyword/s into the lastSeenList.

Using the lastSeenList allows users to make changes e.g `delete` command using the numbered index of a single `find` command.

The editing mechanism is used by the basic find features: `FindDescriptionCommand`, `FindCalorieCommand`, 
as well as the advanced find features: `FindAllCommand` and `FindEitherCommand` to look for keywords in the list.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the lastSeenList for a `find` command.

Step 1. The user executes a `find e/ running` This `find e/ running` command will intialize the lastSeenList to a new ActivityList and is made up of Activities that contains the `running` keyword as per the command.
This lastSeenList will not point to any other activityList in the dayMap hashmap.
![lastSeenList third state](diagrams/thirdStateOfLastSeenList.PNG)
*Figure 12. Third state of lastSeenList*

The following sequence diagram shows how the lastSeenList is set after a find command.

![Find Sequence Diagram](diagrams/FindSequenceDiagram.jpg)

*Figure 13. Sequence diagram of setting the lastSeenList after a find command*

<br>
<br>

### 4.5 List feature after `find` or `list` commands

#### 4.5.1 Current implementation
The mechanism used to display the lastSeenList invoked by the list or find commands is facilitated by the listDrawer and findDrawer class respectively. They both work the same way but the list produced by findDrawer has an extra column which contains the dates of the respective entries.

The following sequence diagram shows how the listDrawer class is used to display the lastSeenList.

![list_Drawer](diagrams/listDrawer.PNG)

*Figure 14. Sequence diagram of the usage of listDrawer to display the list*

<br>
<br>

### 4.6 Edit activity in list feature

#### 4.6.1 Current Implementation

The editing mechanism is used by `EditFoodCommand` and `EditExerciseCommand` to amend the current list of activities.

The following Sequence Diagram shows how `EditFoodCommand` is carried out when the user issues edit command, in this case, `edit 1 f/ egg c/ 10`:

![Edit_Food](diagrams/EditFood.png)

*Figure 15. Sequence diagram of edit food feature*

> `EditExerciseCommand` diagram has a similar logic.

![Edit_Exercise](diagrams/EditExercise.png)

*Figure 16. Sequence diagram of edit exercise feature*

<br>

**Design considerations:**

Aspect: How to edit activity

>Alternative 1 (current choice): Same command able to edit both activities, food and exercise in list.
>* Pros: Easy to implement.
>* Cons: Have to ensure that the different type of editing is implemented correctly.

>Alternative 2: Have separate commands for editing the different activity type.
>* Pros: Clear distinction of the classes.
>* Cons: Increase in number of lines. Separate methods with similar logic will be created.

<br>
<br>

### 4.7 Chaining feature

#### 4.7.1 Current Implementation

The chaining mechanism can be used by the various commands available The following are the types of command that can be chained:
- list
- add
- edita
- graph
>this is due to attribute canBeChained in those commands being true.

The following sequence diagram shows how the chaining works after command is entered:

![Chain_Command](diagrams/ChainCommand.png)

*Figure 17. Sequence diagram of chaining feature*

![Object_Diagram_Of_PrepareCommand](diagrams/chainCommand_PrepareCommand.png)

*Figure 18. Object diagram of allowed PrepareCommand subclass*

![Object_Diagram_Of_Command](diagrams/chainCommand_Command.png)

*Figure 19. Object diagram of allowed Command subclass*

<br>

**Design considerations:**

Aspect: Which features to chain

>Alternative 1 (current choice): Allow only certain commands to be chained.
>* Pros: Able to better track input of users.
>* Cons: User must know which commands can be chained.

>Alternative 2: Allow all commands to be chained.
>* Pros: Easy to implement.
>* Cons: May give abnormal behaviour.

<br>
<br>

### 4.8 Move feature
This feature allows the user to manually `move` activities from one position to another position 

The following sequence diagram shows how the `move` command is executed, where index1 is the position to be moved from and index 2 is the position to be moved below. 

![Move_command](diagrams/moveCommand.png)

*Figure 20. Sequence diagram of move feature*

<br>
<br>

### 4.9 Graph feature

The graph implementation shows the progress of the daily net 
calories over the period of 7 days. The GraphProperty class extracts the available days from the 
stored data in the application.

The days are sorted accordingly and the latest 7 days are chosen from the sorted list. 
The GraphProperty class extracts these data and calculates the attributes needed to build the graph. The GraphDrawing class makes use of these properties
to draw the graph.

> Examples of graph properties include:
> 1. Maximum/minimum calories
> 1. Calorie interval
> 1. 2-Dimensional array representation of the graph

![Graph_Sequence_Diagram](diagrams/GraphSequenceDiagram.png)

*Figure 21. Sequence diagram of move feature*

As shown above, when the execute command of GraphCommand is called, the GraphProperty object 
is created, the properties of the graph are then stored and calculated in setProperty function.

Next, the graphDrawing object is created and uses the properties calculated earlier to print out the graph.
> In the case where there are less than 7  days stored, all the days will be displayed.

<br>
<br>
