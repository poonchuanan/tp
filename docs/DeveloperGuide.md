    | Hello! I'm traKCAL.                                                              |
    | Please do input 'help' for the commands and their respective input format.       |
    ====================================================================================
    ```

7. You will then be prompted to create a new user profile.  


<br>
<br>    
    
## 3.0 Design 

### 3.1 Architecture

![ArchitectureDiagram](diagrams/ArchitectureDiagram.png)

*Figure 1. Architecture diagram of traKCAL*

The Architecture Diagram shown above explains the high-level design of **traKCAL**. There are 8 components in traKCAL, and their functionalities will be discussed below:

<br>

### 3.2 Ui component

![Ui Component](diagrams/ui.png)

*Figure 2. Diagram for UI component*

The UI component deals with interactions with the user by displaying appropriate messages to the user, including the welcome message and appropriate error messages whenever an error has been detected. 


<br>

### 3.3 Logic component

![Logic Component](diagrams/LogicComponent.png)

*Figure 2. Diagram for logic component*


 \* This means that there are multiple PrepareCommand children classes inherited by the PrepareCommand class.

The main bulk of data processing takes place in the logic component. In this component, 
the data from the user input is checked for its validity and parsed down further to the PrepareCommand class to its respective command classes.
These command classes are derived from the Command class. Each different command block deals with the 
proposed functionality which can be associated with `Ui`,`storage` or `model` components. 

* **traKCAL** uses the parser class to filter based on command words by user.
* Description that comes after is further parsed down by the PrepareCommand class 
and validity of those description are checked..
* Respective Command object is created and is executed by **traKCAL**.
* Respective execution methods can be further associated with `UI`, `Storage` and `Model` components.

<br>

### 3.4 Model component

![Model_Component](diagrams/model.png)

*Figure 3. Diagram for Model component*


In the Model component, 

* Contains a hashmap, dayMap, where the key is the date and the value is the list of activities for the respective day.
* Contains a list of activities, lastSeenList where this list would contain the activities 
* Does not depend on any of the other components.

<br>

### 3.5 Command component

Before executing the command, user input has to be prepared first to ensure that all the parameters are correctly in place. 
This is done by the PrepareCommand class.

![Prepare_Component](diagrams/PrepareCommand.png)

*Figure 4. Diagram for PrepareCommand*

After preparing the user input and ensuring that all necessary parameters are in place, the respective prepareCommand classes will return a 
command which will be executed by traKCAL. Below shows all the different Command classes inherited.

![Command_Component](diagrams/Command.png)

*Figure 4. Diagram for Command component*

<br>

### 3.6 Storage component

**traKCAL** saves both user profile data and activity entries in a text file and csv (comma separated values) file respectively. <br>
It also handles the logging file that records down the different types operations or errors that was performed during the program.

![Storage_Component](diagrams/storage.jpg)

*Figure 5. Diagram for Storage component*

<br>

On program launch:

1. `Storage` is initialised and checks for existing saved data.
2. If saved data exists, `Storage` will read the saved data and parses them into model objects such as activity lists for the activity data.
3. Else, if saved data does not exist, `Storage` will create an empty save file in the tpData directory.
4. New users will be prompted to create their profile by inputting their details and saved through `UserInfoStorage`.

On Command execution:

* Whenever the user changes the list by performing an operation such as *add* or *delete* entry, `Storage` parses the model objects and writes into the csv file.
* The respective logs will also be updated according to the given commands through `Logging`.
* `UserSetStorage` will store the relevant shortcuts created by the using *createSet* command is called.

<br>

### 3.7 Exception component

This component contains all the exception classes used in traKCAL.

![Exception_Component](diagrams/Exception.png)

*Figure 6. Diagram for Exception component*

<br>

### 3.8 UserProfile component

This component contains the information such as the user's name, gender, height, weight, active level and the weight goal. 

![userProfile](diagrams/UserProfile.png)

*Figure 4. Diagram for UserProfile component*

<br>
<br>

## 4.0 Implementation

## 4.1 Create User Profile feature

#### Current Implementation

The sequence diagram below shows how the components will react to a new user or for a returning user. 

![CreateNewUserFeature](diagrams/createNewUserFeature.png)

*Figure 7. Components interactions for **traKCAL** create user profile feature*

The following has been omitted from the diagram to increase readability: 
* Exception handling 
* External text file creation block

<br>

#### Design Considerations

* New users are required to create a new user profile before being able to use other features like `graph` to avoid unnecessarily being thrown exceptions.
* Genders were limited to female and male instead of other genders like binary as our recommended calories equation only took into account female and male as genders.
* Similarly, weight goals were limited to lose, maintain or gain as opposed to other forms of weight goal like cut as our current equations were only able to accomodate lose, maintain or gain.

<br>
<br>

## 4.2 Shortcut feature

### 4.2.1 Creating a shortcut

#### Current Implementation

The sequence diagram below shows how the components in **traKCAL** work together to create a new shortcut. 

Users can create a shortcut with unlimited number of entries in this format: `createSet **SHORTCUT_NAME** ...`

Some examples include:
>`createSet **SHORTCUT_NAME** f/ **FOOD_DESCRIPTION** c/ **CALORIE_COUNT** + f/ **FOOD_DESCRIPTION** c/ **CALORIE_COUNT**`

>`createSet **SHORTCUT_NAME** e/ **EXERCISE_DESCRIPTION** c/ **CALORIE_COUNT**`

>`createSet **SHORTCUT_NAME** e/ **EXERCISE_DESCRIPTION** c/ **CALORIE_COUNT** + e/ **EXERCISE_DESCRIPTION** c/ **CALORIE_COUNT** + f/ **FOOD_DESCRIPTION** c/ **CALORIE_COUNT**`

![createSetFeature](diagrams/createSetFeature.png)

*Figure 8. Components interaction for **traKCAL** create set feature*

<br>

#### Design Considerations

* At least one activity tag (`e/` or `f/`) and calorie tag (`c/`) must be specified by user for a shortcut to be created.
* The order of the entry must be activity tag first before calorie tag. Calorie tag followed by activity tag is not allowed. This is to facilitate the adding of each entry in the shortcut, as seen in [section 4.3](#43-add-activity-feature).
* Multiple entries in shortcut should be separated by a `+`. 

<br>
<br>

### 4.2.2 Using a shortcut to add to a activity list

#### Current Implementation

The sequence diagram below shows how the components in **traKCAL** work together to add entries in a shortcut to the activity list. 

Users can call any existing shortcut in this format: `addSet **SHORTCUT_NAME**`

![addSetFeature](diagrams/addSetFeature.png)

*Figure 9. Components interaction for **traKCAL** add set feature*


<br>

#### Design Considerations

* Activities added using shortcuts are only added to the activity list for the current date.

<br>
<br>


## 4.3 Add activity feature

#### Current Implementation

The adding mechanism is used by `AddFoodCommand` and `AddExerciseCommand` to add to the list of date stated in user input. If date is not stated, then it will be added to today's list.

The following sequence diagram shows how `AddFoodCommand` is carried out when the user issues add command, in this case, `add f/ food c/ 170 d/ 2020-10-22`:

![Add Food](diagrams/addFoodFeature.png)

*Figure 10. Component interactions for add food command*

> `AddExerciseCommand` diagram has a similar logic.


<br>

#### Design Considerations

Aspect: How to add food/exercise

>Current choice: Using single letter words as tags for input commands. (e.g. add f/ jelly c/ 100 d/ 2020-11-09)
>* Pros: Faster and shorter input keys for user.
>* Cons: Have to ensure that user is clear on what tags to input.

>Alternative: Using full words as tags for input commands. (e.g. add food/ chicken chop calorie/ 70 date/ 2020-11-08)
>* Pros: Tags are obvious in what input is expected.
>* Cons: More wordy input needed from user.


Aspect: Input parameters for add food/exercise

>Current choice: Input format for adding: `add f/ FOOD_DESCRIPTION c/ CALORIE_COUNT <d/ DATE>` OR `add f/ EXERCISE_DESCRIPTION c/ CALORIE_COUNT <d/ DATE>`
>Where words in CAPS are parameters to be filled by the user and word in <this> are optional. Not including the <date> parameter would add to today's list.
>* Pros: Faster and shorter input time for user.
>* Cons: Have to ensure that user entry would be added to the correct date.

>Alternative: Input format for adding: `add f/ FOOD_DESCRIPTION c/ CALORIE_COUNT d/ DATE` OR `add f/ EXERCISE_DESCRIPTION c/ CALORIE_COUNT d/ DATE`
>Where words in CAPS are parameters to be filled by the user. 
>* Pros: List where food/exercise entry to be added to is clear.
>* Cons: Longer input time for user.

<br>
<br>

### 4.4 Listing feature for find and list commands

The listing mechanism used by `ListCommand` and `FindCommand` to display the required list of activities is facilitated by the lastSeenList of class `ActivityList`. 
The lastSeenList is the list that the user would see after a `list` or `find` command. <br>
The following operations could be applied to the lastSeenList which would change the actual data in the database:

- delete
- move
- edit

The details of those operations can be found further down.

<br>

#### 4.4.1 List

The `list` command displays the list of entries for the current date while the `list <DATE>` command displays the list of entries for the date as specified by the <DATE> parameter.

For example, 
* A `list 2020-11-11` command would use the activityList for 2020-11-11 as the lastSeenList.<br>


Given below is an example usage scenario and how the lastSeenList behaves for different `list` commands.

<br>

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The lastSeenList will be pointed to the ActivityList for today's date.
This means that any `edit`, `delete` or `move` commands will be performed on the ActivityList for today's date in this case, the date would be 2020-11-12.
![lastSeenList first state](diagrams/initialStateOfLastSeenList.PNG)
*Figure 12. First state of lastSeenList*

<br>

Step 2. The user executes a `list 2020-11-10`. This `list 2020-11-10` command causes the lastSeenList to be pointed to the actvityList for 2020-11-10.
This This means that any `edit`, `delete` or `move` commands will be performed on the activityList for 2020-11-10.
![lastSeenList second state](diagrams/secondStateOfLastSeenList.PNG)
*Figure 13. Second state of lastSeenList*

<br>


The following sequence diagram shows how the lastSeenList is set after a “list date" command where date is of YYYY-MM-DD or after a “list” command where the date is the current date.

![Listing feature for find and list commands](diagrams/setLastSeenList.png)

*Figure 14. Sequence diagram of setting the lastSeenList after a `list` command*

#### Design considerations

* Allowing the user to view the list of activities for the current date by not including the `<DATE>` parameter would make it easier for the user.

<br>
<br>

#### 4.4.2 Find

This listing feature for the `find` command also uses the lastSeenList which is of ActivityList class.  <br>
The lastSeenList is the list that the user would see after a `list` command. <br>
Using the lastSeenList allows users to make changes e.g `delete` command using the numbered index of a single `find` command.

For example, 
* A `find e/ food` command would loop through the dayMap and add activities containing the keyword/s into the lastSeenList.

The editing mechanism is used by the basic find features: `FindDescriptionCommand`, `FindCalorieCommand`, 
as well as the advanced find features: `FindAllCommand` and `FindEitherCommand` to look for keywords in the list.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the lastSeenList for a `find` command.

Step 1. The user executes a `find e/ running` This `find e/ running` command will intialize the lastSeenList to a new ActivityList and is made up of Activities that contains the `running` keyword as per the command.
This lastSeenList will not point to any other activityList in the dayMap hashmap.
![lastSeenList third state](diagrams/thirdStateOfLastSeenList.PNG)
*Figure 12. Third state of lastSeenList*

<br>

The following sequence diagram shows how the lastSeenList is set after a find command.

![Find Sequence Diagram](diagrams/FindSequenceDiagram.jpg)

*Figure 13. Sequence diagram of setting the lastSeenList after a find command*

<br>
<br>

### 4.5 Displaying the list after `find` or `list` commands

#### 4.5.1 Current implementation
The mechanism used to display the lastSeenList invoked by the list or find commands is facilitated by the listDrawer and findDrawer class respectively. 
They both work in a similar manner but the list produced by findDrawer has an extra column which contains the dates of the respective entries.

The following sequence diagram shows how the listDrawer class is used to display the lastSeenList.

![list_Drawer](diagrams/listDrawer.PNG)

*Figure 14. Sequence diagram of the usage of listDrawer to display the list*

#### Design considerations
* The list displayed to the user after both `find` and `list` commands has enough whitespace between the columns and rows to make it easier for the user to view the entries.
* The list displayed to the user after a `find` command has the date attribute at the left hand side of the list so as to make it easier for the user to connect the entries found to the respective date, making it easier for the user to make changes accurately

<br>
<br>

### 4.6 Edit activity in list feature

#### 4.6.1 Current Implementation

The editing mechanism is used by `EditFoodCommand` and `EditExerciseCommand` to amend the current list of activities.

The following Sequence Diagram shows how `EditFoodCommand` is carried out when the user issues edit command, in this case, `edit 1 f/ egg c/ 10`:

![Edit_Food](diagrams/EditFood.png)

*Figure 15. Sequence diagram of edit food feature*

> `EditExerciseCommand` diagram has a similar logic.

<br>

#### 4.6.2 Design considerations

Aspect: How editing is carried out

>Current choice: User MUST pull out the list they want to edit to before calling the edit function. `list` then `edit f/ FOOD_DESCRIPTION c/ CALORIE_COUNT` OR `edit e/ EXERCISE_DESCRIPTION c/ CALORIE_COUNT`
>* Pros: The entry that is being edit is clear to the user.
>* Cons: More steps requried to edit an entry.

>Alternative: Adding a date tag in edit: `edit f/ FOOD_DESCRIPTION c/ CALORIE_COUNT d/ DATE` OR `edit e/ EXERCISE_DESCRIPTION c/ CALORIE_COUNT d/ DATE`
>* Pros: Faster and shorter time to edit an entry.
>* Cons: If list of the date is not pulled out and edit carried out immediately, high chance of the wrong entry being edited as there might be recent changes to the list.

<br>
<br>

### 4.7 Chaining feature

#### 4.7.1 Current Implementation

The chaining mechanism can be used by the various commands available The following are the types of command that can be chained:
- list
- add
- edit
- graph

The following sequence diagram shows how the chaining works after command is entered:

![Chain_Command](diagrams/ChainCommand.png)

*Figure 17. Sequence diagram of chaining feature*

![Object_Diagram_Of_PrepareCommand](diagrams/chainCommand_PrepareCommand.png)

*Figure 18. Object diagram of allowed PrepareCommand subclass*

![Object_Diagram_Of_Command](diagrams/chainCommand_Command.png)

*Figure 19. Object diagram of allowed Command subclass*

<br>

#### 4.7.2 Design considerations

Aspect: Which features to chain

>Alternative 1 (current choice): Allow only certain features to be chained.
>* Pros: Able to better track input of users.
>* Cons: User must know which commands can be chained.

>Alternative 2: Allow all features to be chained.
>* Pros: Easy to implement. Attribute canBeChained marked as true for all features.
>* Cons: May give abnormal behaviour. As some features have dependencies on other features.

<br>
<br>

### 4.8 Move feature
This feature allows the user to manually move an activity from one position to another.

The following sequence diagram shows how the `move` command is executed, where index1 is the position to be moved from and index 2 is the position to be moved below. 

![Move_command](diagrams/moveCommand.png)

*Figure 20. Sequence diagram of move feature*

<br>
#### Design Considerations

* Pros: The tags `from/` and `below` was used to make this command more intuitive for the user.
* Cons: For the user to move an activity from a position to the 1st position, the index tied to the `below/` tag would have to be 0 which may not be as clear to the user. 
        For example, `move from/ 2 below/ 0`


<br>

### 4.9 Graph feature

The graph implementation shows the progress of the daily net 
calories over the period of 7 days. The GraphProperty class extracts the available days from the 
stored data in the application.

The days are sorted accordingly and the latest 7 days are chosen from the sorted list. 
The GraphProperty class extracts these data and calculates the attributes needed to build the graph. The GraphDrawing class makes use of these properties
to draw the graph.

> Examples of graph properties include:
> 1. Maximum/minimum calories
> 1. Calorie interval
> 1. 2-Dimensional array representation of the graph

![Graph_Sequence_Diagram](diagrams/GraphSequenceDiagram.png)

*Figure 21. Sequence diagram of move feature*

As shown above, when the execute command of GraphCommand is called, the GraphProperty object 
is created, the properties of the graph are then stored and calculated in setProperty function.

Next, the graphDrawing object is created and uses the properties calculated earlier to print out the graph.
> In the case where there are less than 7  days stored, all the days will be displayed.

<br>
<br>

#4.10 Delete feature

![Delete_Sequence_Diagram](diagrams/DeleteSequeunceDiagram.png)

* Figure 13. Sequence diagram of delete by index feature

## 5.0 Appendix: Requirements

### 5.1 Product scope

{Describe the target user profile}
* Tech savvy university students that have knowledge on the exercise and calories or know where to get the information before inputting it in the application.
    - Fast typist
    - Prefers desktop applications
    - Prefers typing to mouse interactions
    - Conscious about daily calorie intake
    - Conscious about weight
    - Is reasonably comfortable using CLI applications

<br>

#### 5.1.2 Value proposition

{Describe the value proposition: what problem does it solve?}
* Functionality
    - Provides greater flexibility of use.
    - Can be used to do things that are difficult or impossible to do with a GUI.

#### Editing user profile

>Editing user name and gender
>* Test case: `user e/ n/ Sam , g/ female`
>* Expected: User name will be changed to `Sam` and user gender will be changed to `female`.
 
>Editing user activity level
>* Test case: `user e/ al/ 3`
>* Expected: User activity level will be changed to `3`.
 
>Incorrect inputs to try:
>* `user e/ n/        `: empty description for name
>* `user e/ g/ meIsMale`: invalid gender type
